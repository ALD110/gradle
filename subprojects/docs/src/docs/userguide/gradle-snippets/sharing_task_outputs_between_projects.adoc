= Sharing outputs between projects

You want to share a file made by a task in one project with a task in another project.
For example one task makes a file, and the other task uses the file.

== Example

.Settings
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/gradle-snippets/sharing-task-outputs-between-projects/groovy",files="settings.gradle[]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/gradle-snippets/sharing-task-outputs-between-projects/kotlin",files="settings.gradle.kts[]"]
====

.Producer's build
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/gradle-snippets/sharing-task-outputs-between-projects/groovy",files="producer/build.gradle[]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/gradle-snippets/sharing-task-outputs-between-projects/kotlin",files="producer/build.gradle.kts[]"]
====

.Consumer's build
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/gradle-snippets/sharing-task-outputs-between-projects/groovy",files="consumer/build.gradle[]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/gradle-snippets/sharing-task-outputs-between-projects/kotlin",files="consumer/build.gradle.kts[]"]

== Anti-patterns:

[WARNING]
.Don't reference other project tasks directly
====
A frequent anti-pattern to declare cross-project dependencies is:

[source,groovy]
----
dependencies {
   // this is unsafe!
   implementation project(":other").tasks.someOtherJar
}
----

This publication model is _unsafe_ and can lead to non-reproducible and hard to parallelize builds.
